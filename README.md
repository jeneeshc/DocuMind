# DocuMind

**Breaking the Document Intelligence Trilemma**
*A Generalizable Hybrid AI Framework for Multi-Model Document Processing*

## Overview
Based on the premise that organizations face a critical operational bottleneck in the "last mile" of data preparation, DocuMind serves as an **Intelligent Orchestrator**. It decouples reasoning from execution by using LLMs solely to configure and supervise specialized, low-cost tools.

Prototypes indicate a potential cost reduction of over **99%** for structured data tasks and a context window reduction of **90%** for long-form contracts.

## Core Technologies

### 1. Digital Data Transformation
Transforms massive structured datasets (CSV/XLS) using LLM-generated logic (Python/JSONata). Logic is synthesized once and executed locally, ensuring speed and data privacy.

### 2. Structured Document Intelligence
"Self-Healing" forms that use LLMs to dynamically repair broken OCR templates. If a layout shifts or noise interferes, the orchestrator recalibrates without human intervention.

### 3. Semantic Text Analysis
Uses "Semantic Pruning" (RAG-Light) to filter documents before analysis. This focuses the LLM on only the most relevant pages of complex contracts, reducing hallucinations and costs.
