# DocuMind: Enterprise-Grade Hybrid AI Document Orchestrator

## Jeneesh Jose

DocuMind is a next-generation document intelligence platform designed to handle complex, multi-format document workflows. It leverages a **Hybrid AI Framework** that combines deterministic logic, structured extraction with self-healing capabilities, visual understanding, and semantic reasoning to process everything from spreadsheets to unstructured legal contracts.

## IRS Forms download for Stream B - Digital and native PDF forms

## Fill the digital downloaded forms with random data to test the position based extraction logic

## Normalization for Stream A (Structured Data)

This code converts CSV, XLSX, XML, and JSON files into a Pandas DataFrame and a canonical JSON format.

 - Scans the specified folder for .csv files.
 - For each CSV, reads it into a Pandas DataFrame.
 - Converts the DataFrame to a list of dictionaries (canonical JSON format).
 - Writes that list to a .json file with the same base name in the same folder (or a separate output folder if you change output_dir).
 - Prints progress and any errors.

### RQ2 (Cost Optimization)
 - Required Fields: document_id, stratum, cascade_cost, baseline_cost
 - Readiness: We have the "Gatekeeper" routing logic.
 - Gaps:
 - We need a testing script that forces a document through both paths (Cascade vs. Direct Baseline) to log the comparative token costs.

## Custom Degradation Pipeline for RQ2 Scanned strata
### Key Advantages of This Approach
 - Controlled variability: You can adjust skew angles, noise levels, and brightness to test different degradation levels 
 - Known ground truth: Since you start with your filled digital forms, you know exactly what text should be extracted
 - Reproducible: The random seeds can be fixed for reproducible experiments
 - Realistic artifacts: The combination of skew, noise, and brightness variation simulates real scanning conditions
